# Deterministic-Chaos-in-the-Lorenz-Equations
### Introduction
The Lorenz equations were first studied by Edward Lorenz in 1963 as a simplified model of weather patterns.
Rayleigh had previously studied the fluid flow in a uniform layer when the temperature difference between the
upper and lower surfaces of the layer is maintained at a constant value. Such a system has a steady state solution
where the temperature varies linearly with depth (no big surprise), but under certain circumstances, the solution is
unstable. In those cases, convection can develop, and the convection can be chaotic.
Lorenz explored this situation further,2 developing the following set of coupled first-order differential equations to
describe the fluid flow and temperature gradients:

For our purposes, we donâ€™t need to understand the origin and interpretation of the model. We will just be solving
the equations numerically to explore what happens when different initial conditions are present.
